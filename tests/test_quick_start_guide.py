<content>
Welcome to Pyxie! This guide will help you create your first site by combining the simplicity of Markdown with the power of FastHTML layouts.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Markdown and Python
- A text editor of your choice

## Installation

Install Pyxie using pip:

```bash
pip install pyx2
```

## Project Setup

Create a new directory for your site and set up a basic structure:

```
my-site/
├── posts/          # Your markdown content
├── layouts/        # Your layout files
├── static/
│   └── css/       # Your CSS files
└── main.py        # App initialization
```

Create your app initialization file (`main.py`):

```python
from fasthtml.common import *
from pyxie import Pyxie

# Initialize Pyxie with content and layout directories
pyxie = Pyxie(
    "posts",                # Where to find your markdown content
    live=True              # Enable live reloading for development
)

# Create FastHTML app with Pyxie middleware
app, rt = fast_app(
    htmlkw=dict(lang="en"),
    middleware=(pyxie.serve_md(),)  # Serve markdown versions at {slug}.md
)
```

The `serve_md()` middleware automatically makes your original markdown content available at a `.md` endpoint. For example:
- Your post at `/blog/hello` will also be available at `/blog/hello.md`
- This works even if you customize the URL slug in your frontmatter
- Perfect for LLMs and other tools that need access to the raw markdown

That's it! Pyxie will automatically:
- Find layouts in `layouts/`, `templates/`, or `static/` directories
- Cache processed content for better performance
- Use the "default" layout if none is specified

Want more control? You can customize the initialization:
```python
pyxie = Pyxie(
    "posts",
    layout_paths=["custom/layouts"],   # Use custom layout directories
    default_layout="basic",            # Change the default layout
    cache_dir=".cache"               # Enable caching in specific directory
)
```

## Styling Your Content

Pyxie and FastHTML are framework-agnostic - you can use any CSS solution you prefer. For this quick start guide, we'll use Tailwind CSS with its Typography plugin as it's one of the fastest ways to get beautiful content styling.

Create `static/css/input.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

/* Enable the Typography plugin for styling markdown content */
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
```

The Typography plugin provides ready-to-use classes that will style your markdown content with:
- Beautiful typography and spacing
- Responsive font sizes
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Styled lists and blockquotes
- Code block formatting

Don't want to use Tailwind? You can:
- Write your own CSS classes
- Use any CSS framework you prefer
- Import existing design systems
- Create custom styling per layout

## Creating Layouts

Now let's create a simple layout that will style our markdown content. Create `layouts/default.py`:

```python
@layout("default")
def default_layout(metadata):
    """Basic blog post layout."""
    return Div(
        # Header with title - safely get from frontmatter or use default
        H1(metadata.get('title', 'Untitled'), 
           cls="text-3xl font-bold"),
        
        # Main content slot with typography styling
        # First argument (None) is the default content if no <content> tags exist
        # The div won't render at all if the slot is empty
        Div(None, data_slot="content", 
            cls="prose dark:prose-invert"),
        
        cls="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 py-8"
    )
```

Let's break down how this layout works:

1. **Metadata Handling**:
   - `metadata.get('title', 'Untitled')` safely retrieves the title from your frontmatter
   - If the title doesn't exist, it defaults to 'Untitled'
   - This pattern prevents errors if frontmatter fields are missing

2. **Slot Behavior**:
   - `Div(None, data_slot="content")` creates a content slot
   - The first argument (`None`) is what shows up if no content is provided
   - If your markdown doesn't include `<content>` tags, the div won't appear in the final HTML
   - This helps prevent empty containers in your output

The `prose` class will style your markdown content if you're using Tailwind Typography. 

## Writing Content

With our styling and layout ready, let's create our first post. Create `posts/hello.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello, Pyxie!"
date: 2024-03-20
status: published
---

<content>
# Welcome to My Site

This is my first Pyxie post! The content inside this XML-style block
will be inserted into our layout's content slot and styled automatically.

You can write regular markdown here:
- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](/somewhere)

<!-- Mix in some HTML if you want -->
<div class="custom-class">HTML works too!</div>

<!-- Use FastHTML for dynamic content -->
<fasthtml>
# Import components from your app
from components import Button
from datetime import datetime

def Greeting():
    return Div(
        H1("Hello, World!", cls="text-3xl font-bold"),
        P(f"The time is: {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M')}"),
        Button(text="Click me!", onclick="alert('Hello!')")
    )

# Use show() to render FastHTML components
show(Greeting())
</fasthtml>

Back to regular markdown content...
</content>
```

Let's break down what's happening in this post:

1. **Content Flexibility**:
   - Write regular markdown anywhere
   - Mix in HTML when needed
   - Use <code>&lt;fasthtml&gt;</code> blocks for dynamic Python-powered content

2. **FastHTML Blocks**:
   - Wrap Python code in <code>&lt;fasthtml&gt;</code> tags
   - Import components from anywhere in your app
   - Define new components inline
   - Use any Python functionality you need

3. **The `show()` Function**:
   - Use `show()` to render FastHTML components in your content
   - Can show single components or multiple at once
   - Perfect for dynamic content, interactive elements, or complex layouts
   - Components are rendered in place where `show()` is called

This flexibility means you can:
- Keep simple content in clean markdown
- Add HTML wherever you want
- Use FastHTML when you need dynamic features
- Import and reuse components across your site

## Next Steps

With a post and layout defined now you can:

1. Add more content in the `posts` directory
2. Create more sophisticated layouts
3. Customize your styling
4. Set up your routes

<conclusion>
You've now created your first Pyxie site! The combination of Markdown content and FastHTML layouts gives you the flexibility to create exactly the site you want, while keeping your content clean and maintainable. Check out our other guides to learn more about Pyxie's powerful features:
